In development June 2015 - July 2015

This script, intended for execution on a Raspberry Pi 2 Model B running Debian/Ubuntu, was written for a high altitude balloon payload with sensor arrays, cameras, radio, and GPS. The program is capable of local data logging as well as two-way communication with multiple groundstations at once. The payload transmits a wide range of telemetric information including GPS position, temperature, accelerometric orientation, memory space, battery level, and humidity, and controls a balloon release mechanism driven by a linear servo motor.

The script was successfully executed in a high altitude balloon launch on July 30th, 2015.
